11/12/2022, 23:54 - Chioma Uwawke AB: To returnees and Other residents of  Anambra and neigburing  states,be guided.

This Month of December and January won't be a Palatable one to most of us as usual.

It's either we're affected or indirectly affected.

The Main unknown gunmen (ESN) are out of the state and what we have now that isc causing mayhem are kidnappers. Fully armed  Kidnappers.

Their main target are Jeeps and  flashy vehicles before but now they knew people are disguising now so they are also using their brain to access the occupants of   any vehicle they come  across.  and they automatically conclude that you have money. The next thing is story.

Try to Avoid, Nnewi-Ozubulu-Akamili road at any point in time this Christmas

Avoid Umunze-Isuochi road at late hours

Avoid Aguluezechukwu Road completely.

Avoid Lilu/Orsumoghu, Ukpor, Orsumenyi, part of Orsumoghu, and section of Azia and Mbosi junction road.

Avoid Nnobi-Ideani road at odd hours and always apply caution while driving. 

Avoid Nkpor-Uke road and always back it up with prayers when plying that route Cause it's always insecure at anytime.

Avoid Awgbu-Amaokpala new road Cause there's a hideout on that mini-flyover axis according to survilance reports.

Nnewi South should be 65% avoided at any hour

Avoid Igboukwu-Umuchu-Umunze road. Especially that terrible road In Umuchu before Umunze , tuo ya gap.stay away from.it. 

Avoid Igbariam road leading to Okalakwu

Avoid Aguluezechukwu!!
Avoid Aguluezechukwu!!
Avoid Aguluezechukwu!!. Biggest Trap .

Anambra state is the most unsafe State in Southeast at the moment if not Nigeria as kidnappers are having a Field day here. Only few towns have strong internal security network.but what happens when you leave that town is the  point . 

Do with this information whatever that.  pleases you and  share to create the awareness.

17/12/2022, 06:41 - Chioma Uwawke AB: Please stay at home today being Saturday, 17/12/22 between the hours of 8a.m - 10a.m as the government has declared a clean up exercise in all parts of the state. 

This plea has become necessary as unknown to you, there are men (delegated by the government) that are ready to give you a hot chase if they found you walking or driving in the streets or roads. If they catch you are under the law to pay a stipulated fine.

 God bless you as you listen and heed to this advise.

Please send to every body or group you know to keep them abreast of this information.

Nnewi branch will be having her end of year party today let's get ready.

Time:   3pm
Venue: Banking hall
Host:    Nnewi branch welfare team

As regards the environmental sanitation exercise,
There is no sign of restrictions on both human and vehicular movements in and around nnewi though I don't of other suburb areas of ANAMBRA. 
   No singular sign of environmental excercise here, even onitsha shuttle buses are working as I speak. So as many that can find their way to office can do so.

Thank you all

- When  *GOD*  wanted to create *TREES*, he spoke to the *EARTH*. 

- But when  *GOD*  wanted to create  *MAN*, he turned to  *HIMSELF*.

31/12/2022, 13:26 - Bright O: *¬£1 = ‚Ç¶980*
*$1 = ‚Ç¶890*
*‚Ç¨1 = ‚Ç¶810*

*ATTENTION*

*In case you don't know the root cause of our problems today, please take time out and read below:*

*As of 25/07/2022, the exchange rates were:*

*¬£1 = ‚Ç¶800*
*$1 = ‚Ç¶670*
*‚Ç¨1 = ‚Ç¶662*

*42 years ago, precisely on 25/07/1980 the exchange rate was:*
*$1 = 0.80k*

*Are you surprised?* 

*Well, we were far more productive in 1980 than we are today.*

*In 1980 the key reasons for economic growth were as follows:*

*1. We were a net exporter of refined petroleum products. Today we import all our refined petroleum products.*

*2. We rode in locally assembled cars, buses and trucks. Peugeot cars in Kaduna and Volkswagen cars in Lagos.*

*3. Leyland produced  trucks/buses in Ibadan and ANAMCO in Enugu also produced buses and trucks.*

*4. Steyr in Bauchi produced our Agricultural tractors. And it was not just Assembly, we were producing many of the components:*

*5. Vono products in Lagos produced the vehicle seats.*
 
*6. Exide in Ibadan produced the batteries, not just for Nigeria but for the entire West Africa.*

*7. IsoGlass and TSG in Ibadan produced the windshields.*

*8. Ferrodo in Ibadan produced the brake pads and discs*

*9. Dunlop produced Tyres  in Lagos and Michelin Tyres were produced in Port Harcourt. And I mean tyres produced from rubber plantations located in Ogun, Bendel and Rivers State.*

*10.  We were listening to Radio and watching television sets assembled in Ibadan by Sanyo.*

*11. We were using refrigerators, freezers and Airconditioners produced by Thermocool and Debo.*

*12.  We were putting on clothes produced from the UNTL Textile Mills in Kaduna and Chellarams in Lagos. They were Not from imported cotton but from cotton grown in Nigeria.*

*13.  Our water was running through pipes produced by Kwalipipe in Kano and Duraplast in Lagos .*

*14.  Our toilets were fitted with WC produced in Kano and Abeokuta.*

*15  We were cooking with LPG gas stored inside gas cylinders produced at the NGC factory in Ibadan.*

*16. Our electricity was flowing through cables produced by the Nigerian Wire and Cable, Ibadan; NOCACO in Kaduna and Kablemetal in Lagos and Port Harcourt.*

*17.  We had Bata and Lennards Stores producing the shoes we were putting on. The shoes were not from imported leather but from locally tanned leather in Kaduna*.

*18.  We were mainly flying our Airways, (the Nigeria Airways), to most places in the world. The Nigeria Airways was about the biggest in Africa at the time*.

*19. Most of the foods we ate were grown or produced in Nigeria*.

*We were producing all of the above and many more in 1980*

*Today, we import almost everything. Isn't that alarming?*

*There lies the source of the terrible exchange rate we are experiencing today and everyone reading this has a critical role to play in reversing this very UGLY trend.*
 
*We have been talking about these problems and more for ages.*

*It is not enough for us to complain about the exchange rate or point out what others are not doing or are failing to do. The key questions are:*

*1. What are we producing now?*
*2. What role are our so- called Leaders/ Politicians of today playing?* 

*We are forever shying away from responsibility whereas it is a stack reality and if we don't deal with it, it won't go away. In fact it will get worse*.

*To our dear Politicians, if you don't have the capacity to RESET Nigeria to what it was at least back in 1980 then please stay in your house and don't waste our time.*

*ENOUGH IS ENOUGH !!!*

*Please share widely on all platforms for Nigerians especially youths to know the critical role to play with.. #Fixing_Nigeria*.

*WE NEED A PERSON WITH VERY GOOD THINKING FACULTY PEOPLE TO RULE/LEAD OUR NATION.*

31/01/2023, 13:04 - Chioma Uwawke AB: By Uncle Ebo Whyte

I met Tom, a passionate young man in his early 20‚Äôs in 2002, when he hosted me on his TV programme and we remained friends since. He went on to add value to himself - a double masters and a chartered marketer status from CIM, which made him hot cake on the job market. He was in hot demand internationally and at one time I told him that he had become a non-resident Ghanaian because of his frequent travels. I told him to slow down but he laughed my concerns off. He said he was working so hard because he wanted to retire at age 40. He could not retire at 40 but at 45, he was one of the most successful young men in Ghana. He was twice divorced because the women could not take his hectic schedule, almost insane focus on his career leaving no room for anyone or anything else. After the second divorce he resolved not to bother with marriage again. He chose career over relationship.

He lived in a dollar-rated mansion rented for him by his multinational employer and when he was ready, he spent one and a half years on building his dream house and it was a masterpiece of a building. The house was ready for  occupancy in November 2022 but Tom decided to wait and move in on 1st January 2023.

On 30th December, he complained of congestion in his chest. He drove himself to hospital and was admitted immediately. The next morning, he was gone. Dead. He did not spend even one night in his dream house. As at today, the caretaker is still living in the house as the family fight over who to occupy it.

I am addressing this message to extremely successful, young persons, who work hard but unfortunately, have no balance in their lives. This old man has a few suggestions for you:

1)   Life is not guaranteed to any of us so make the most of today. Take time to celebrate the fact that you are alive today. For tomorrow never comes.

2)   Make time for those you love even as you work hard to give them a comfortable life. Don‚Äôt exchange your presence with presents.

3)   Pay attention to your health. Money and assets are useless without good health.

4)   Stress kills so pace yourself and learn to relax from time to time. Make time for a hobby or a passion. Don‚Äôt make your life all work, deadlines and targets. Get some balance into your life.

5)   Find love and invest in making it work until you have built an enduring and supportive relationship. Success is empty without anyone to share it with. Pay attention to your relationships.

6)   Take your spiritual life seriously. It is the blindness of youth that when we are young we do not see the point of developing a spiritual life and taking spirituality seriously enough. By the time most people wake up to the importance of having a good spiritual life, they have already made a mess of their lives.

I thank God that he has blessed and continues to bless many of our young people. Please pay attention to getting some balance in your lives; else someone will eat the fruit of your labour and not you yourselves.

Life is more than work. In this life, the journey is as important as the destination.

Don‚Äôt postpone living.

01/02/2023, 10:53 - John Ikoyo: * The cash is being shared to the security and the cleaners and not Bako and co. 

* It is reasonable to imply that the securities will be present at the bank fulfilling their duties during that hour. Therefore, they can‚Äôt be a part of the bonding.

16/02/2023, 08:17 - BM Godwin Aigbekan: NATIONAL BROADCAST BY HIS EXCELLENCY MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT, FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA ON THE CHALLENGES OF THE CURRENCY SWAP AND STATE OF THE NATION, ON 16th FEBRUARY, 2023

My Dear Compatriots,

 ‚ÄãI have found it necessary to address you today, on the state of the nation and to render account on the efforts of our administration to sustain and strengthen our economy, enhance the fight against corruption and sustain our gains in the fight against terrorism and insecurity which has, undoubtedly, been impacted by several internal and external factors.

2.‚ÄãParticularly, I am addressing you, as your democratically elected President, to identify with you and express my sympathy, over the difficulties being experienced as we continue the implementation of new monetary policies, aimed at boosting our economy and tightening of the loopholes associated with money laundering.

3.‚ÄãLet me re-assure Nigerians, that strengthening our economy, enhancing security and blockage of leakages associated with illicit financial flows remain top priority of our administration. And I shall remain committed to my oath of protecting and advancing the interest of Nigerians and the nation, at all times.  

4.‚ÄãIn the last quarter of 2022, I authorised the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to redesign the N200, N500, and N1000 Nigerian banknotes.

5.‚ÄãFor a smooth transition, I similarly approved that the redesigned banknotes should circulate concurrently with the old bank notes, till 31 January 2023, before the old notes, cease to be legal tender.

6.‚ÄãIn appreciation of the systemic and human difficulties encountered during implementation and in response to the appeal of all citizens, an extension of ten days was authorized till 10th February, 2023 for the completion of the process. All these activities are being carried out within the ambit of the Constitution, the relevant law under the CBN Act 2007 and in line with global best practices.

7.‚ÄãFellow citizens, while I seek your understanding and patience during this transient phase of implementation, I feel obliged to avail you a few critical points underpinning the policy decision. These include:

a. The need to restore the statutory ability of the CBN to keep a firm control over money in circulation. In 2015 when this administration commenced its first term, Currency-in-Circulation was only N1.4trillion.
b. The proportion of currency outside banks grew from 78%in 2015 to 85% in 2022. As of October 2022, therefore, currency in circulation had risen to N3.23 trillion; out of which only N500 billion was within the Banking System while N2.7 trillion remained permanently outside the system; thereby distorting the financial policy and efficient management of inflation;
c. The huge volume of Bank Notes outside the banking system has proven to be practically unavailable for economic activities and by implication, retard the attainment of potential economic growth;
d. Economic growth projections make it imperative for government to aim at expanding financial inclusion in the country by reducing the number of the unbanked population; and
 
e. Given the prevailing security situation across the country, which keeps improving, it also becomes compelling for government to deepen its continuing support for security agencies to successfully combat banditry and ransom-taking in Nigeria
 

8.‚ÄãNotwithstanding the initial setbacks experienced, the evaluation and feedback mechanism set up has revealed that gains have emerged from the policy initiative.

9.‚ÄãI have been reliably informed that  since the commencement of this program, about N2.1 trillion out of the banknotes previously held  outside the banking system, had been successfully retrieved.

10.‚ÄãThis represents about 80% of such funds. In the short to medium and long terms, therefore, it is expected that there would be:

a. A strengthening of our macro economic parameters;
b. Reduction of broad money supply leading to a deceleration of the velocity of money in the economy which should result in less pressures on domestic prices;
c. Lowering of Inflation as a result of the accompanying decline in money supply that will slow the pace of inflation;
d. Collapse of Illegal Economic Activities which would help to stem corruption and acquisition of money through illegal ways;
e. Exchange Rate stability;
f. Availability of Easy Loans and lowering of interest rates; and
g. Greater visibility and transparency of our financial actions translating to efficient enforcement of our anti- money laundering legislations.
11.‚ÄãI am not unaware of the obstacles placed on the path of innocent Nigerians by unscrupulous officials in the banking industry, entrusted with the process of implementation of the new monetary policy. I am deeply pained and sincerely sympathise with you all, over these unintended outcomes.

12.‚ÄãTo stem this tide, I have directed the CBN to deploy all legitimate resources and legal means to ensure that our citizens  are adequately educated on the policy; enjoy easy access to cash withdrawal through availability of appropriate amount of currency; and ability to make deposits.

13.‚ÄãI have similarly directed that the CBN should intensify collaboration with anti-corruption agencies, so as to ensure that any institution or person(s) found to have impeded or sabotaged the implementation should be made to bear the full weight of the law.

14.‚ÄãDuring the extended phase of the deadline for currency swap, I listened to invaluable pieces of advice from well meaning citizens and institutions across the nation.

15.‚ÄãI similarly consulted widely with representatives of the State Governors as well as the Council of State. Above all, as an administration that respects the rule of law, I have also noted that the subject matter is before the courts of our land and some pronouncements have been made.

16.  ‚ÄãTo further ease the supply pressures particularly to our citizens, I have given approval to the CBN that the old N200 bank notes be released back into circulation and that it should also be allowed to circulate as legal tender with the new N200, N500, and N1000 banknotes for 60 days from February 10, 2023 to April 10 2023 when the old N200 notes ceases to be legal tender.

17.‚ÄãIn line with Section 20(3) of the CBN Act 2007, all existing old N1000 and N500 notes remain redeemable at the CBN and designated points.

18.‚ÄãConsidering the health of our economy and the legacy we must bequeath to the next administration and future generations of Nigerians, I admonish every citizen to strive harder to make their deposits by taking advantage of the platforms and windows being provided by the CBN.

 

19.‚ÄãLet me assure Nigerians that our administration will continue to assess the implementation with a view to ensuring that Nigerians are not unnecessarily burdened. In this regard, the CBN shall  ensure that new notes become more available and accessible to our citizens through the banks.

20.‚ÄãI wish to once more appeal for your understanding till we overcome this difficult transient phase within the shortest possible time.

21.‚ÄãFellow citizens, on the 25th of February, 2023 the nation would be electing a new President and National Assembly members. I am aware that this new monetary policy has also contributed immensely to the minimization of the influence of money in politics.

22.‚ÄãThis is a positive departure from the past and represents a bold legacy step by this administration, towards laying a strong foundation for free and fair elections.

23.‚ÄãI urge every citizen therefore, to go out to vote for their candidates of choice without fear, because security shall be provided and your vote shall count.

24.‚ÄãI however admonish you to eschew violence and avoid actions capable of disrupting the electoral processes. I wish us all a successful General Elections.

Thank you for listening. God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

 We will have cold weather, MORE THAN THE COLD WEATHER EVER, which will have an impact on flu, cough, difficulty breathing, etc.
 We must increase immunity by consuming many vitamins and supplements to strengthen it.
   The distance from Earth to the Sun is 5 light minutes or 90,000,000 km.  The Aphelion phenomenon takes us 152,000,000 km away from the sun, that is, 66% further away.
   The air will be colder, our body is not used to this temperature, the difference is great.
    We must keep our health conditions to the maximum, it does not matter if it is cloudy or sunny, the increase in cold will feel the same!!!
  
  - Please, share this information with as many people as possible so that they also take forecasts... WRAP YOURSELF WELL.

17/02/2023, 15:46 - Theresa AB: The official campaign for the 2023 election is coming to an end 

Take 1 Minute & Ponder On These:

1.No face cap can cover your hunger for 4 years

2 .No T-shirt can protect you from insecurity for 4 years

3.5kg rice cannot help your belly for 4 years4.1ltr groundnut oil cannot sustain your kitchen for 4 years

5.4 yards of Ankara cannot cover poverty for 4 years.

6.If someone offers you 10k for campaign or voting, ask yourself this question
How much do they give to their children as pocket money per month?

7.Remember, your 10k is for 4 years, and it is once and for all. 

8.Think about your value,
Think about your voice,
Think about your future,
You are also human, you must not die on the crumbs table

9.Politicians are not Nigerians than you are. 
The power is in your hands.

10.If the best candidate does not have the chance to win, waste your vote on him without a second thought.

11.It is better to live a fulfilled life, than voting for your own problems.
It is the best thing to do.
You have a chance to speak in the future.

12.Remember you are not suffering as a Yoruba, Hausa or Igbo, but as a  Nigerian.
Reject all ethnical cards that are unfavorable to your future.

13.Reject every religion card,no church or mosque pays your children school fees, voting your religion members doesn't put food on your table

14.They will visit you during campaign, but you will never see them again until the next campaign.

15.Work for an accountable candidate.

16.Election is local ,but politics is international.
The outcome of election will not only affect you, it affects all Nigerians irrespective of where they are.

17.Think about the character and integrity of your candidate.

18.Don't submit yourself as campaign thug,
the children of politicians are enjoying winter abroad.

They don't go out with knife, gun  or charms.
Their lives are very important to their parents.

Be wise,
Be smart,
Be thoughtful.
Be focused 

God bless Nigeria üá≥üá¨üá≥üá¨üá≥üá¨

Festus Okoye Esq. 
National Commissioner & Chairman
Information and Voter Education Committee.

 THIS IS WHAT THE NEW ELECTORAL LAW SAYS ON OUR NEXT ELECTIONS*:

1. No manual accreditation.

 2. No use of incident forms.

3. All accreditation is electronic.

4. Accreditation is Bimodal meaning facial recognition and fingerprinting.

5. No pre-election cases after the conclusion of Elections.

6. No election cases after swearing into office of the winner.

7. All results must be uploaded to INEC official website at the polling units before taking it to the ward, constituency, LGA, or state collation centers.

8. If the number of votes cast is more than the number of accredited voters the polling unit result is canceled.

9. No more agreement between parties to share the remaining ballot papers that were not used.

10. No more massive thump printing and stuffing of ballot boxes. If you like to go and steal ballot boxes you are wasting your time. You cannot change the result.

The people's votes are counting now. If you didn't serve the people well when in public office or you are not popular in your political locality, it is advisable to save your money because they will collect your money and vote against you.

End ballots snatching has come to stay in Nigeria.  With the amendment of the Nigeria Electoral Act,  our votes now count.

Please share this information in other platforms you are added to for wider coverage.

Anyhow you can get money between today and tomorrow, get and keep it , also whatever transfer you want to do, do it between today and tomorrow, information am hearing is that , as from Thursday, bank network will go off till Sunday or Monday, so that politicians will not be able to transfer money to anybody for vote , so buy enough food at home, do ur transfer now .

 Because the next five days is likely to be difficult pls.

US has mandated the Presidency to work against vote buying by all possible means 

If vote buying continues, Nigeria  will destroy democracy

How to know my polling unit.

*Unit Confirmation* 

Having a pvc is no longer a guarantee that you will vote. If your name has been migrated to another PU from where you've been used to (even if you made no request for change of location ) in line with the above reason, on voting day, you may not be allowed to vote there.

It is therefore imperative that all registered voters check the exact location of their polling unit days b4 Election Day in order to avoid stories that touch the heart.

*VERIFY IN LESS THAN 60 SECONDS.* 

If you are a registered voter, check your  status via link below. It is seamless, innovative and reliable. Simply Select your: 

1.) State
2.) Surname
3.) Date of Birth

 *Please, help circulate widely!*
22/02/2023, 17:52 - BM Godwin Aigbekan: *Since Emefiele has been the most mentioned name in Nigeria in the last few weeks, I think Oxford Dictionary should consider creating a space for him in the dictionary*.

*For example*:
Emefiele / eme-fi-ele/ adjective: hard, difficult.
Verb: Emefiele
Past Tense: Emefieled
Present Continuous: Emefieleing
Present Perfect: Emefielize*
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
*E.g:*
... Some girls always like to emefielize  things
... The test was emefielistic
... I had a very emefielized week.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
*#Emefiele*:  To complicate, make things worse, unbearable.
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
*E.g:*
... Please don't come and emeficate issues here.
... The only way to reduce applicants is to emeficate  the process
... How was your exam? It was emefielic!!

03/04/2023, 20:11 - Ishola Empire: 1. Don't sell products. Sell results and solutions.

Don't talk about what your product can do.

Talk about what the product can do for them.

You don‚Äôt sell a camera by saying it can shoot video at 25,600 ISO. You sell it by telling people it can shoot video in the moonlight.

2. Get into their world.

Talk about what they care about their problems, fears and desires.

Then start discussing ways they can solve them. They're likely to give an immediate "Yes!"

3. We are emotional creatures, not logical.

Sell towards emotions and feelings.

For instance, if you want to sell a family business, you can discuss your family‚Äôs problems and explain how you feel about their situation.

4. Be Specific.

Don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúLose weight fast.‚Äù

Instead, say: "Lose 10 pounds in 3 weeks without diet and exercise!"

5. Take advantage of FOMO (fear of missing out).  

Set a hard deadline when the sale ends and create a sense of urgency.

- Use countdown timers
- Highlight limited availability
- Show social proof
- Use language that creates urgency

6. Don't make it boring.

Be entertaining and exotic.

Don't sound like a generic company. Put jokes in your text. Be different.

GET ANY MONEY YOU TRANSFER MISTAKENLY BACK. NO HIDING PLACE FOR FRAUD IN NIGERIA ANY MORE

In case you mistakenly transfered Money to wrong account and the account refused to refund your money or owner blocked you?  

Or you are duped through your bank account? 

and then later realized that you have been scammed 

For or a mistake on your part? And the receiving bank is not cooperating?

HOW TO RETRIEVE YOUR MONEY AFTER YOUR WRONG TRANSFER

Please read this careful and share

Many people don't always know what to do, so today am sharing with you things you do, when you realize a the person you paid for a service or goods is avoiding you:

1. Write out the Full name and account number of the page or person.

2. Go to the last notification your bank sent you after you made the payment (via mobile app or text) copy out the "TRANSACTION ID NUMBER".

3. Go to any branch of the scam artist's bank (the bank you transferred to), ask to see the CUSTOMER SERVICE in charge of FRAUD.

While you are there, send an email to SCAMMER'S BANK or the d bank u wrongly paid to and copy 
CBN FRAUD DESK. (anticorruptionunit@cbn.gov.ng) n also cpd@cbn.gov.ng
& contactcbn@cbn.gov.ng, this will ginger the bank to take it up fast.

What should you expect from this? 
The culprit/suspects account will be PLACED ON HOLD. His BVN will be blocked permanently. No account will ever be opened neither will he be able to transact banking business in that name until he clears himself with the bank.

Meaning he/she cannot transfer or withdraw until they visit the bank, and when they do, the bank will contact the police and the suspect when proven guilty will sign a waiver allowing the bank to refund your money.

Endeavour to Share because you never can tell who it might help.

May Nigeria Succeed

What a lesson!!
19/08/2023, 20:59 - Ishola Empire: A TENANT IS NOT ENTITLED TO REFUND OF RENT WHERE HE UNILATERALLY SURRENDERS TENANCY

The position of the law, is that where a tenant surrenders a tenancy on his own volition, he is not entitled to a refund of rent, whether or not the tenancy agreement has been signed. HOWEVER, if the landlord lets out the premises to a third party, the tenant is entitled to a refund of the period of his existing tenancy that the third party pays for.

This was stated by the Nigerian Supreme Court in MRS. AISHA ABDURAHMAN & ANOR V. MRS. SHADE THOMAS (2019) 12 NWLR (PT.1685) 107 AT 129 ‚Äì 130, paras G ‚Äì A, where Aka‚Äôah JSC stated that:
"In a tenancy contract, there is no refund of rent after payment. If the tenant surrenders before the contract is executed, the landlord may return the amount gained which was let out during the subsistence of the tenancy which was surrendered. Apart from that, a tenant is not entitled to refund of rent."

The court further stated that:
‚ÄúIn a landlord and tenant relationship, there is no provision for refund of rents if a tenant unilaterally surrenders the premises after the contract has been executed. Where such a situation occurs, the usual practice is that the tenant will be entitled to receive repayment of rent of the unexpired term from the date the premises is re-let before the expiration of the tenancy. See: Nigerian Construction and Holding Company Ltd v. Owoyele (1988) 4 NWLR (Pt. 90) 588 at 603."

Finally, the Court said that:
"It is unreasonable for a tenant to expect full refund of the rent after possession of the premises for some months and deciding to terminate the tenancy simply because he has secured an alternative accommodation. It does not make sense to accommodate such proposition. It is feasible to entertain such claim only if the Landlord is guilty of frustrating the contract‚Äù

The new ‚ÄòStrategic Agenda for the Naira‚Äô was announced by the Central Bank of Nigeria, generating a healthy national debate. Before we undertake a nationwide enlightenment program (beginning November 2) to educate the public on the new policy, it is important to clarify some of the issues/questions that are emerging.

Needless to emphasize that to appreciate the full impact of the new policy on the Naira/national economy, we need to take the 4-point agenda as a package. As a package, the new agenda will:

better anchor inflation expectations,
strengthen public confidence in the Naira,
make for easier conversion to other major currencies,
reverse tendency for currency substitution,
eliminate higher denomination notes with lower purchasing power,
reduce the cost of production, distribution, and processing of currency,
promote the usage of coins and thus a more efficient pricing and payments system,
promote the availability of cleaner notes,
deepen the Forex market,
ensure more effective liquidity management and monetary policy,
convertibility of the Naira and hence greater confidence in the national economy and lead to greater inflow of foreign investment
position the Naira to become the ‚ÄòReference currency‚Äô in Africa.
However, most of the questions so far pertain to only one aspect of the agenda, i.e., currency Re-denomination. We have monitored the reactions so far, and note that the concerns/questions raised so far are similar to the ones raised in all the countries that have undertaken re-denomination, including Ghana that is still implementing it now. We clarify some of the concerns as follows:



ùêñùê°ùêöùê≠ ùê¢ùê¨ ùêúùêÆùê´ùê´ùêûùêßùêúùê≤ ùê´ùêûùêùùêûùêßùê®ùê¶ùê¢ùêßùêöùê≠ùê¢ùê®ùêß?
Currency redenomination is the process where a new unit of money replaces the old unit with a certain ratio. It is achieved by removing zeros from a currency or moving some decimal points to the left, with the aim of correcting perceived misalignment in the currency and pricing structure, and enhancing the credibility of the local currency.

ùêáùê®ùê∞ ùê∞ùê¢ùê•ùê• ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùêçùêöùê¢ùê´ùêö ùêõùêû ùê´ùêûùêùùêûùêßùê®ùê¶ùê¢ùêßùêöùê≠ùêûùêù?

It is by dropping two zeros from the currency or moving two decimal places to the left. The name of the national currency will still be the Naira. However, during the transition period, the existing Naira will be referred to as the ‚ÄúOld Naira‚Äù, and the new one to be called the ‚ÄúNew Naira‚Äù. After the transition period, the word ‚ÄúNew‚Äù may be dropped. For example, the following equivalents will obtain as we re-denominate:

ùêéùê•ùêù ùêçùêöùê¢ùê´ùêö
(ùê¢.ùêû, ùêÑùê±ùê¢ùê¨ùê≠ùê¢ùêßùê† ùêçùêöùê¢ùê´ùêö ùêöùê¨ ùêöùê≠ ùê≠ùê®ùêùùêöùê≤)

50 kobo	Half kobo**
N 1	= 1 kobo coin
N 2	= 2 kobo coin
N 5 = 	5 kobo coin
N 10	 = 10 kobo coin
N 20	 = 20 kobo coin
N 50 = 	50 kobo coin or note***
N 100	= N 1 note
N 200	N 2 note**
N 500	= N 5 note
N 1000 = 	N 10 note
N 2000*	= N 20 note



ùêáùê®ùê∞ ùê∞ùê¢ùê•ùê• ùê¢ùê≠ ùê∞ùê®ùê´ùê§?
The ‚Äònew Naira‚Äô coins and notes will be different from the existing ones i.e. in design, appearance, security features, etc.
All Naira assets and liabilities (including bank deposits), prices, fees, rents, and contracts (including salaries and wages) will be re-denominated by dropping two zeroes or moving two decimal points to the left.
During the ‚Äòtransition period‚Äô prices will be quoted in both the ‚Äònew Naira‚Äô and the ‚ÄòOld Naira‚Äô and everyone will choose whether to pay in the new or old Naira. These five months will be allowed so that everyone will get familiar with the conversion, and it will become self-evident to everyone why he/she would prefer to transact in the ‚Äònew Naira‚Äô rather than the ‚Äòold Naira‚Äô. For example, if a bag of garri sells for N2,000 (old Naira), the price in ‚Äònew Naira‚Äô will automatically be N20. The customer will choose to pay either N2000 in old Naira or N20 in the ‚Äònew Naira‚Äô. In the supermarkets and formal markets, prices will be displayed in both ‚Äòold‚Äô and ‚Äònew‚Äô Naira. In the informal markets where prices are negotiated, the negotiation could be done in the ‚Äòold Naira‚Äô as usual and converted into the ‚Äònew Naira‚Äô if the customer wishes to pay with the ‚Äònew Naira‚Äô. This will ensure that prices do not rise due to rounding-up. The five months are also needed for everyone (formal and informal sectors) to become fully familiar with the conversion. It will become obvious to everyone that N50,000 of the ‚Äòold Naira‚Äô has the same purchasing power as N500 of the ‚Äònew Naira‚Äô. The question then would be: why carry N50,000 of old Naira when N500 of the new Naira will buy you the same thing? Consequently, if you have N50,000 in your bank account, it will automatically become N500 in the ‚Äònew Naira‚Äô i.e. if you want to withdraw in the ‚Äònew Naira‚Äô or you can still withdraw N50,000 in ‚Äòold Naira‚Äô during the transition period (January 2024). Similarly, someone whose monthly salary is N50,000 can choose (during the transition period) whether to withdraw and spend the N50,000 in ‚Äòold Naira‚Äô or N500 in the ‚Äònew Naira‚Äô. Both would buy him/her the same value of goods and services.
Examples of price equivalents in the new and old Naira could be:

ùêáùêûùê´ùêû ùêöùê´ùêû ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùêúùê°ùêöùêßùê†ùêûùê¨ ùê≠ùê°ùêöùê≠ ùê∞ùê®ùêÆùê•ùêù ùê≠ùêöùê§ùêû ùêûùêüùêüùêûùêúùê≠ ùêõùê≤ ùêâùêöùêßùêÆùêöùê´ùê≤ ùüêùüéùüêùüí ùêÄùê¨ ùê©ùê•ùêöùêßùêßùêûùêù ùêõùê≤ ùê≠ùê°ùêû ùêÄùêùùê¶ùê¢ùêßùê¢ùê¨ùê≠ùê´ùêöùê≠ùê¢ùê®ùêß ùê®ùêü ùêÅùê®ùê•ùêö ùêÄùê°ùê¶ùêûùêù ùêìùê¢ùêßùêÆùêõùêÆ.

House rent (e.g. a flat in some parts of Nigeria)	N5000 per month	N50 per month
 	Stock price of a company	Assume it is, say:
N20 or N80	
20 kobo or 80 kobo
 	Airline ticket for domestic flight	N12,500	= N125
Fuel Price N500 = N5
 	Exchange rate: N to US$	Assume it is say:
N125
Or N130
Or N100 to US$1.	
N1.25 = US$1
Or N1.30 = US$1
Or N1  = US$1

This decision has been taken by the cbn by the directive of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu to reduce the surfering of Nigerians and also slow down inflation. If you have the old Naira start getting ready to switch to the new Naira, this message is meant to prepare Nigeria for the changes ahead. It needs to be shared to ensure everyone is well prepared for the new Naira notes. Nigerians 
Renowned hope is coming.

11/09/2023, 14:23 - Emeka Ab: Devaluation of currency doesn't help a developing economy (nation) especially on the long run. At the short run, it may look good.
The major problem of our economy is that we don't produce things for export and the wicked politicians stock dollars in their ecolag bags and overhead tanks thereby making it very sarce for importers, expectedly, the law of demand and supply comes to play, these are the major causes of surge in the exchange rate.

01/10/2023, 21:58 - Ishola Empire: Happy independence everyone. 

We just moved to Ikorodu that year. Thieves and burglars were rampant. 

I was coming back from school that day when I saw a naked man tied to a tree with wounds, swollen face and injuries begging me for mercy. Anu e shey mi, so i walked towards him and untied him. Emi good samaritan. He ran as quickly as possible, then someone jumped out from the uncompleted building beside the tree shouting ‚Äúe jade o, omo yii ti tu ole yen sile oo‚Äù

Everyone jumped out and started pursuing him but they didn‚Äôt catch him. I eventually found out he is a thief that vigilante caught and were teaching lessons. They only left him for a while only for me to release him.

It took the elders hours to beg for me. Vigilate wanted to tie me to the tree so i can continue the beating from where he stopped. The area wasn‚Äôt even our area o. They paraded me sha. ‚ÄúAburo ole‚Äù üò≠

20/11/2023, 12:51 - Otunba Kuajo: Mathematics of successful life

*I found this to be very interesting and meaningful message to share*:-

```IF:
A = 1 
B = 2 
C = 3  
D = 4;
E = 5  
F = 6;
G = 7  
H = 8;
I = 9  
J = 10  
K = 11  
L = 12
M = 13  
N = 14 
O = 15  
P = 16
Q = 17 
R = 18 
S = 19  
T = 20 
U = 21  
V = 22 
W = 23  
X = 24
Y = 25 
Z = 26.```

*THEN,*

```H+A+R+D+W+O+R+K
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11
= 98%

K+N+O+W+L+E+D+G+E
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5
= 96%

L+O+V+E
12+15+22+5 
= 54%

L+U+C+K
12+21+3+11 
= 47%

None of them makes 100%.

Then what makes 100%?

Is it Money?
NO!

M+O+N+E+Y
13+15+14+5+25```
= *72%*

E+D+U+C+A+T+I+O+N
5+4+21+3+1+20+9+15+14 
= *92%*

Leadership?
NO!

L+E+A+D+E+R+S+H+I+P
12+5+1+4+5+18+19+8+9+16
= *97%*

Every problem has a solution, only if we perhaps change our *ATTITUDE*...

*A+T+T+I+T+U+D+E* = 1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5  = *100%*

*It is therefore OUR ATTITUDE towards Life and Work that makes OUR Life 100% Successful.*
        üß†üß†üß†

27/11/2023, 16:30 - BM Godwin Aigbekan: Dear Colleagues,

 

I hope this mail meets you very well!

 

This is to communicate Management‚Äôs approval of N45,000  as this year‚Äôs Christmas cash gift for Rice and Oil.

 

As you are aware, to whom much cash is given, more PAYE is expectedüòäüòäüòä ‚Ä¶.. Please note that the tax deduction would reflect accordingly in Dec 2023 payroll i.e. your usual monthly 25th net pay would be reduced slightly.

 

@BMs: A separate mail will be sent for the cash gift for our Security and cleaners staff.

 

We look forward in earnest to a successful month of November!

 

Best regards,

03/12/2023, 19:38 - Olusola Fatimilehin: Dear All,

¬†

Good Evening,

Sequel to new regulatory guidelines from Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) to TELCOs (MTN, AIRTEL, 9MOBILE & GLOBACOM) on CUG Services charge and need to put a cap/limit on calls and SMS allocated to CUG Lines, the following now applies.

¬†

Total allocated call time monthly (Minutes Allowable for call monthly on CUG to CUG Lines only): 900 Minutes (No longer unlimited)
Total Number of allocated SMS monthly (SMS Allowable monthly on CUG to CUG Lines only): 40 SMS (No longer unlimited)
¬†

To this end, we are advised to use alternative channels of communication like Skype_Calls, Zoom_Meetings etc. for longer talk time conversations/communications to avoid exhausting the allotted limits on calls and SMS somewhere in the middle of the month.

¬†

We will continue to monitor sufficiency of our current package and advise the management accordingly if there‚Äôd be need for upward review in the future however for now the status quo remains.

¬†

Thanks and have a productive week/month.

In the spirit of gratitude and appreciation, I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt thanks to each and every one of you.

Although there were many uncertainties in 2023, these did not draw us back from not recording some  success story. Our success story is not just about hitting targets or achieving milestones; it's about the collective efforts, resilience, and passion that you, my exceptional colleagues, have poured into every target, and challenge that came our way.

Choose anyone you can be consistent with, meet a good carpenter to help you construct a piggy bank. 

Say NO to reckless spending in year *2024* 
Nothing is too small. *CONSIDERATIONS FOR 2024* 
________________________
1. *ON EARNING* :
Never depend on single income. Make investment to create a second chance.
_________________________
 *2. ON SPENDING* :
If you buy things you do not need, soon you will have to sell things you need.
________________________
3. *ON SAVINGS:* 
Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving.
________________________
4. *ON TAKING RISK:* 
Never test the depth of a river with both feet.
__*______________________
5. *ON INVESTMENT* :* 
Do not put all eggs in one basket.
________________________
6. *ON EXPECTATIONS:* 
Honesty is a very expensive gift. Do not expect it from cheap people.
________________________
7. Past is a waste paper, present is a newspaper, and future is a question paper. Come out of your past, control the present, and secure the future.
________________________
8. When bad things happen in your life, you have three choices. You can either let it define you, let it destroy you or you can let it strengthen you.
_______________________
9. Our eyes are in the front because it is more important to look ahead than to look backwards.
_______________________
10. We use pencil when we were young, but now we use pens. Do you know why? Because mistakes in childhood can easily be erased, unlike now.

 *Wishing you a prosperous 2024.*

04/03/2024, 11:50 - Chioma Uwawke AB: *Blood clot*

Mr. Ibu died of Blood Clots in his leg. 
This is the disease that almost killed me. 

I still have a clot in my left leg. 200,000 Nigerians die of Blood Clot annually. Please know the symptoms. I almost died if not for medical intervention.

This was 3 years ago‚Ä¶

I lived with undiagnosed DVT for several months‚Ä¶

Then it dislodged and traveled to my lungs, causing Pulmonary Embolism‚Ä¶

I almost died‚Ä¶

Breathing was like stabbing myself with every draw of air‚Ä¶

Already walking was almost impossible‚Ä¶

At one point, I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed because of the pain‚Ä¶

Doctors couldn‚Äôt find what was wrong‚Ä¶

Blood tests and X-ray couldn‚Äôt find anything‚Ä¶

This is where many Africans become superstitious and conclude that they are being ‚Äòpursued by village people‚Äô‚Ä¶.

I was undiagnosed until the day I almost stopped breathing‚Ä¶

I remember walking into my GP‚Äôs room that morning‚Ä¶

Immediately he saw me, he ordered a D-Dimer blood test‚Ä¶

This is a test that checks for blood clotting problems by measuring the amount of the D-dimer level in your body. 

My result came out positive and he ordered an ambulance to take me straight to hospital‚Ä¶ according to him, I could drop dead any moment from then if I wasn‚Äôt admitted in hospital‚Ä¶

I told him I needed to see my family and kiss them goodbye before being taken to hospital‚Ä¶

I drove myself back to the house, packed my laptop and few clothes, said my goodbyes to the family and drove myself to the hospital‚Ä¶

It was during COVID so hospitals were filled with COVID patients and it took longer to get me admitted‚Ä¶

Once fully admitted, they injected me with CLEXANE‚Ä¶

My oxygen level was dropping‚Ä¶

I was taken in for a CT scan and boom, it was confirmed that I had clots in my lungs. I was diagnosed of Bilateral Massive Pulmonary Embolism. The size of the blood that clotted in my lungs is what was described as massive.

It was then that my physician told me I would have died in 2 days if I didn‚Äôt make it to hospital‚Ä¶

At that point, everything lost value‚Ä¶

I knew I could die any moment‚Ä¶

I called a few friends and prepared them for my potential exit‚Ä¶

I contacted business partners and shared every necessary information they need for continuity‚Ä¶

I blocked my mind from thinking about my son as the thought of him in this world without me was killing me faster than the massive clot in my lungs‚Ä¶

But I had faith in medical science‚Ä¶

I trusted the process‚Ä¶

I surrounded myself with friends in the medical field - from Dr. Idee in the UK who first mentioned i should be checked for DVT/PE, sister Joy in the US, Dr. Adetola in the US and others. 

On ground, I had the best specialists monitoring me closely. 

After 10 days of fighting for my life in hospital, my physician discharged me and said I cheated death.

According to him, blood clots kills faster yet few people are aware of it.

I knew at that point that the universe wanted me to use my story to raise awareness about this killer but unpopular medical condition‚Ä¶

If you sit long hours in flights or at work, you are at a risk of developing a blood clot. 

If you have high blood pressure, cancer or on cancer therapy, your risk of clotting is high. 

If you have a sibling or relative who suffered blood clot, please investigate the possibility of a genetic clotting disorder.

And finally, if you‚Äôre sick and multiple blood tests do not show what‚Äôs wrong with you, do not conclude that the condition is spiritual. You just haven‚Äôt been tested correctly. Some laboratory tests or radiological scans may also not be available in your city. A lot of Nigerians die because they mistook a medical condition for a spiritual problem .

My name is Charles Awuzie and I just wanted to raise awareness about blood clots especially after learning that Mr. Ibu died of clot related complications.
04/03/2024, 12:10 - BM Godwin Aigbekan: What is blood Clots? 
Blood clots are gel-like masses formed by the coagulation (clotting) of blood. They play a crucial role in the body's natural response to injury, preventing excessive bleeding when a blood vessel is damaged. However, problems can arise when blood clots form inappropriately or do not dissolve properly.

There are two main types of blood clots:

Thrombus: This type of clot forms inside a blood vessel and can obstruct blood flow. Thrombi can develop in arteries or veins and may lead to serious health issues. A thrombus that breaks free and travels through the bloodstream is called an embolus.

Embolus: An embolus is a clot or other substance that travels from one part of the body to another through the bloodstream. If an embolus becomes lodged in a smaller blood vessel, it can block the blood flow and cause various complications.

Conditions Associated with Blood Clots:

Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT): Formation of blood clots in deep veins, usually in the legs. If a clot breaks loose, it can travel to the lungs and cause a pulmonary embolism.

Pulmonary Embolism (PE): A blood clot that travels to the lungs, often originating from DVT. It can be life-threatening if not treated promptly.

Stroke: Blood clots in the brain's arteries can lead to a stroke, disrupting blood flow and causing damage to brain cells.

Coronary Artery Disease: Blood clots in the coronary arteries can lead to heart attacks by blocking blood flow to the heart muscle.

Risk Factors for Blood Clots:

Prolonged immobility or bed rest.
Surgery or trauma.
Certain medical conditions, such as atrial fibrillation.
Smoking.
Obesity.
Genetic factors.
Hormonal factors, especially in women using birth control pills or undergoing hormone replacement therapy.
Symptoms of Blood Clots:

Symptoms vary depending on the location and severity of the clot but may include swelling, pain, tenderness, red or discolored skin, and difficulty breathing.

It's essential to seek medical attention if you suspect a blood clot, as prompt diagnosis and treatment can prevent serious complications. Treatment may involve anticoagulant medications to prevent further clot formation or procedures to remove or break up the clot.

13/03/2024, 07:06 - Chioma Uwawke AB: Since the passing of Herbert Wigwe (God rest his souls and comfort his loved ones), I have observed and reflected on the man that he was through different accounts from people who experienced him personally and I am truly in awe.

After watching his funeral, I and my husband had a really interesting conversation around the man that he is and how he was very intentional with giving and nurturing relationships thereby leaving potential fathers and mothers for his children. 

At the end of that conversation we asked ourselves a simple question. If anything were to happen to us today, would our children find fathers and mothers in the friends that we have? Beyond this, we also examined if we were the kind of friends that others can trust to have their backs in similar situations. 

At the end of it, it was a call to action for us to become more giving and trusting to our friends and to be more intentional with nurturing meaningful relationships. Something we felt isn‚Äôt spoken about enough in this generation.

So my question to you reading this is:

üí•What does friendship mean to you? 

üí•Are your friends really your friends is it just vibes and cruise?

üí•Who is in your inner circle?

üí•Who has your back?

üí•If you got into trouble now, who will you call? 

üí•Who can call you when they are in trouble.

üí•Who can trust you to show up for them unconditionally? 

We can‚Äôt do life in isolation. Build your network consciously and the easiest way to do this is to be a quality and valuable human being. 

I hope that find the peace, love and soundmind that you seek.

The troops of 181 Amphibious Batallion, Bomadi Local Government Area of Delta State While on peace mission to OKUOMA community in BOMADI LGA of Delta State were surrounded by some community youths and killed on Thursday, 14 March, 2024. The unfortunate incident occurred  when the troops responded to a distress call after the communal crisis between the Okuama and Okoloba communities both in Delta State. 

The reinforcement team led by the Commanding officer was also attacked, leading to the death of the Commanding officer, two Majors, one Captain and 12 Soldiers. 

The Chief of Defence Staff ( CDS), General Christopher Gwabin Musa has directed the immediate investigation and arrest of those involved in the heinous crime. The occurrence has been reported to the Delta State Govt.  
 
 However, the military remains focused and committed to its mandate of maintaining peace and security in the country.  So far, a few arrests have been made  while steps in place to unravel the motive behind the attack. Additional details later.

16/03/2024, 20:40 - Ishola Empire: Travelogue: Ibadan ‚Äì Hills, Bottoms, Masquerades and Research
By Bayo Adeyinka 

More than 15 years ago, I met an Italian who had lodged at KS Motel at Total Gardens, Ibadan. He was in Ibadan for the first time and was very fascinated with the city when I informed him that Rome and Ibadan shared a unique similarity: both were built on seven hills. He asked me to take him around Ibadan which I did.

The seven hills are Oke Padre, Oke Ado, Oke Bola, Oke Mapo, Oke Are, Oke Sapati and Oke Mokola. But Ibadan is not just a city of hills. It is also a city of ‚Äòbottoms‚Äô. Loosely translated, ‚Äòidi‚Äô means bottom or the backside. Several people have attached sexual innuendoes to the names. However, the actual translation indicates that some of the ‚Äòidis‚Äô indicate how the settlers converged at a point thereby leading to how they arrived at the names given. Go round the city and you can locate Idi-Arere, Idi-Ose, Idi-Ishin, Idi-Ape, Idi-Ayunre, Idi-Obi and Idi-Ito.

For instance, Idi-Arere is a location where the early settlers converged and held meetings under an ‚ÄòArere‚Äô tree. The actual full name is Idi- Igi Arere (under the Arere (obeche) tree). Idi-Arere is located between Oja-Oba and Molete. Idi-Ose, which should actually be Idi-Igi Ose (under the Ose (baobab) tree), is located around Ojoo/Moniya Road. Idi-Ishin is located around Jericho GRA area and was named after the Ishin (ake apple) tree. Idi-Ape is located at the intersection of Iwo Road and Bashorun and was named after the Ape tree. Idi-Ayunre which is located at the outskirts of the city on the way to Ijebu-Ode was named after the Ayunre (Albizia Zygia) tree.
Idi-Obi was named after the kola nut tree. Ditto for Idi-Ikan and Idi-Ito.

Ibadan is also a city with several junctions popularly called ‚ÄòOrita‚Äô. In Yoruba mythology, these ‚Äòoritas‚Äô or junctions are places where sacrifices are offered. Popular oritas in Ibadan are Oritamefa‚Äìa junction that leads to six roads (around UCH), Oritamerin ( a junction that leads to four roads), Orita Aperin, Orita Challenge and Orita Bashorun. Some of the names have been shortened nowadays with Orita Bashorun now simply referred to as Bashorun, Orita Challenge now Challenge and Orita Aperin simply Aperin.


Ibadan is still steep in its traditional beliefs though modernity is fast catching on. One of such is the still very popular egungun masquerade festival which usually takes place around June and July.

And still talking names, several names in Ibadan have their origin in the inability of the residents to pronounce the original names correctly. For example, the place popularly called Oke-Sapati was originally called Shepherd‚Äôs Hill but the illiterate residents couldn‚Äôt pronounce ‚ÄòShepherd‚Äôs Hill‚Äô and it was corrupted to Sapati. That was how it sounded to the ears of the residents at that time. The story behind Kudeti is quite interesting. A river runs around that area and the British District Officer during the colonial era was quite shocked at how dirty the river was. The river served the residents as they washed, bathed, defecated and drank the water. The DO therefore exclaimed, ‚ÄúThis water is TOO DIRTY‚Äù. The illiterate residents now corrupted the words ‚Äòtoo dirty‚Äô to Kudeti.

Ibadan is still steep in its traditional beliefs though modernity is fast catching on. One of such is the still very popular egungun masquerade festival which usually takes place around June and July. When I was younger, this period was a period of fear mixed with excitement. Everyone wants to catch a glimpse of the Oloolu masquerade- except women who are forbidden to see it. Oloolu is the most popular and the most feared. I‚Äôve seen it once before carrying what looked like a flat tray with several items on it.

Several years ago, there was a clash between a very popular Muslim cleric now late, called Ajagbemokeferi and Oloolu. It was rumoured then that Ajagbemokeferi disrobed and unveiled Oloolu. Then, there is Alapansapa. Alapansapa is the second most feared masquerade after Oloolu. Alapansapa dresses very smartly in bright colours. Even though most masquerades are associated with canes and whips, it is more so with Alapansapa. There is also Atipako and Abidielege.


Despite the traditional background of the city and the practices/ beliefs of its residents, Ibadan has been rightly acknowledged as the intellectual capital of the Yorubas.


Despite the traditional background of the city and the practices/ beliefs of its residents, Ibadan has been rightly acknowledged as the intellectual capital of the Yorubas and this is not just because the first University in Nigeria is located in the city. I really don‚Äôt know how many cities in Nigeria have as many research institutes as Ibadan. Ibadan has IITA (International Institute of Tropical Agriculture), IAR&T (Institute of Agricultural Research and Training), FRIN (Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria), CRIN (Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria), NIHORT (National Horticultural Research Institute) and NISER (Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research).

All in one single city! I don‚Äôt know how the State Government leverages these research institutes for the benefit of its citizens.

Ibadan is truly a mix of the ancient and the modern.

23/04/2024, 08:49 - BM Godwin Aigbekan: *Typical case study worth looking into to avoid woman wahala*

JUST A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US* WILL BRING THE NEEDED PEACEüôèüèº

 When I got back this evening, my wife told me that she quarrelled with my neighbour's wife. 

*I was very shocked.*

This was the first time such a thing was happening.

Both women had lived in peace since we became neighbours.

*So I asked her what the problem was.*

My wife told me it was because of the rope where we hang clothes to dry.

My wife wanted to dry her clothes and my neighbour‚Äôs wife wanted to dry her own clothes too.

*One thing led to confrontation, and small thing one person said you insulted me and something led to quarrel.*

My neighbour returned as I was still talking with my wife.

And his hot-tempered wife began to shout at him.

"You better go and warn her husband to warn her. Go and warn the husband to warn his wife or else."

My wife wanted to go out to confront her but I held her back.

"I am home now. Don't go outside."

"If you won't allow me to go, then you better go out and tell her husband to tell his wife to shut her mouth or else I will come for her. Go now and tell him. Go and tell him now"

My wife was angry. She entered the bedroom in anger.

I opened the parlour door to peep outside, at that moment I saw my neighbour also opening the door to come out. 

I thought the man was coming to warn me as his wife instructed. But he didn't. He came to me and said.

"Uncle J, I am sure you have heard about the drama."?

I nodded.

"Yes, I have."

"My wife is very wild. I will not sleep this night if I don't do what she wants. She has asked me to warn you.

I don't know if we can just act the drama small. I will warn you and you will beg me to calm down. So that I can go in and sleep well."

"Haba! No na. If you warn me and I start begging you, you will be sleeping well in your house and my wife will think that I don't have power. She will insult me all night for begging you. 

Your wife will think you are more powerful and superior."

*"So what do we do now?"*

"Let us warn each other. You will warn me and I will warn you. When we warn each other seriously, we can then go inside the house and we both can sleep. That way both women will know that we stood for them."

*My neighbour agreed and we started the fire.*

I warned him very seriously.

He also started warning me. Soon we were shouting at the top of our voices. 

His wife came out of the house and my wife also came out. 

*He ran to carry Hoe, I followed the backyard and brought a very big machete.*

My wife started begging me to go inside. 

His wife was also begging him to drop the hoe.

That was how we both entered inside the house and locked the door. 

*There was silence in the compound.*

My wife kept rubbing my chest and telling me to calm down. While she was still rubbing my chest and head, my neighbor sent me a text.

*"It worked o. Thank you, sir."*

I told my wife to get me cold water to drink.

When she stood up, I replied back.

*"You owe me a bottle of malt."*

I was still typing my message when my wife shouted from the kitchen.

*"But Elder J,* *you have hot temper o.*
*Just this small rope quarrel women are having, you carried machete."*

Prisoners would have lines drawn around them in the dirt, and if they crossed this line then they would be executed by their guards.
